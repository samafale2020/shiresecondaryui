            <h3>Title </h3>
            <p>Shire Jama school is a public school offering elementary and primary basic education for children from grades one to Eight based on the Somali national curriculum. The school was given the name of famous & well-respected man (shire Jamaa Ahmed) who introduced the Somali alphabet 1970s. The name was selected to encourage the literacy promotion among the community and importance of education.
              The thought of the school came through the minds of education practitioners spearheaded by two Education activists in the year 2009 in the Abudwak district of central Somalia. 
              The school was founded to fill the gap of the need for a school in the expansive Abduwak district. This district has been most affected by the collapse of central government, and as a result there was no government service available including education provided in the region. Education services have mainly been provided by the Community, small private-sector or charitable organizations. In the circumstances, their achievement in running any kind of education service is remarkable, but they only operate with limited service which still leaves a large majority of children out of school. In Abudwak only 2 schools were open in 2 villages where many of residents of Abudweak town encountered access challenge including fee, and distance.  It was estimated that 50% of schools in the district did not even have proper classrooms and many buildings are damaged and unsafe.

            <h3>The school was founded on a rented four room house</h3>
            <p>
              
              The main work was raising awareness on the importance of education.  Our effort were in time rewarded when both day as well as evening classes were established. This awareness on the need for access to education was raised through public gatherings, in religious gatherings as well as through campaigns.
              
              Due to the fact that, it was a community initiative, and the fact that there were limited schools around, and that the people are now conscious of the benefits of education, the school gained very wide acceptance and was acknowledged in the region.  The community owned the idea and school philosophy making the school in enrollment day in day out.
              
              So large was the growth in enrollment that the rented space could no longer hold the large number of learners after only six months since the school was established. The facilities other than the building were also highly required such as the teaching and learning materials among other school necessities. The learners also needed some space on which to play and conduct extracurricular activities.

            <ul>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> To be an institute of global excellence in providing quality education and producing students who passionately love their country.  </li>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> To develop well rounded, confident and responsible individuals who aspire to achieve their full potential by providing a welcoming, 
              happy, safe, inclusive and supportive learning environment in which everyone is equal and all achievements are celebrated collectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We believe strongly the role of community players and well-wishers to help in the expansion of the provision of education services to our children. 
              We envision a situation where all children in Somalia will have an opportunity to go to school and learn and later become good citizens of Somalia and of the World.

            <h3> challenges faced the school </h3>
            <p> The school management went back to the community and widely consulted and negotiated with an aim of getting more space to establish a bigger and better education facility that would be able to cater for the larger number of learners. Through a multi stakeholder committee it was agreed that the school should move to a previously established government school that was at the time home to several internally displaced persons.
              The committee of stakeholders took it as their initiative to persuade the Internally displaced persons and their families to evacuate the school building. There was no alternative shelter for the internally displaced people since they were poor economically and there was no government and NGOs to provide hand. The education committee of the school convinced some of the households to voluntarily shift from the school while some material support was offered to extreamly poor families. The school moved to old building of Somali secondary school which was extremely affected by Long term disrepair. 
              
              The Civil conflict in Somalia had left the school in deplorable condition. The years of neglect and misuse had further degraded the school. The school nevertheless started in the school in as good condition as we could by then. Teaching and learning continued as it was going on in the previous school location. We were no longer in a rented house due to space and financial limitations.

              To that end, the community players, Teachers and even learners were all involved in trying to make the school habitable including cleaning and minimal repairs. 
              The management of the institution and all the relevant stakeholders made great strides in formal rehabilitation of the previously deserted educational institution.
               The rehabilitation programme was carried out and saw to the massive expansion of the school in terms of the number of classrooms and the space for other teaching and learning activities. 
              We saw great strides from community members who contributed to the rehabilitation of the school motivated by desire of quality education.
              The Abduwak professionals abroad were particularly instrumental. Tthey constructed a further four classrooms that were not in existence thereon before. 
              However more space was  still needed and the worst classes needed further rehabilitation as the school grew in enrollment  the role of the community in Abduwak was very memorable in the whole process of rehabilitation and construction  of our newly established school.

              Since the days of the rented house, the school has rapidly grown through the community initiative and that of the learners and teachers.
               The school now boasts an upward of 18 classrooms, 3 offices, library room & 3 latrines from only 4 Due to the quality education services and practices and awareness. 
                Especially awareness created by learners to their peers & management led complains towards community ownership in education promotion have made the school enrollment rise to an upward of more than 2000 learners and massive classroom expansion.
                 The school conducted academic performance competition among the classes which inspired learners and out school children to enroll and retain in the school. Community and school management team continuously held coordination and cooperation meetings to discuss and implement school improvement plans. 
              This resulted in community links to school and response to community needs in regard to social, education and peace building.

            <h3> challenges faced the school </h3>
            <p> The school developed a teacher recruitment policy that seeks to recruit only the most qualified teachers into the institution.
                Candidates for teaching positions undergo qualification & reference checkups. This ensured that the quality of education so provided in this school is of the highest possible quality.
                This has in turn made the school the largest in the region based on the number of enrolled learners and most trustworthy to the community. 
                In the last few years after 2014 the school has always featured in the top schools in terms on National examinations performance in Somalia. 
                In 2015, top 3 learners in national examination graduated from this school. In the first grade 8 exam Galmudug state conducted since its formation 2020, the first 2 learners in the rank belongs to shire Jama School. 
                Further more 12 out of the top 10 students of Galmudug state were Shire jama school graduates. 
                The school have therefore had many graduates who have graduated and joined secondary schools, universities and later colleges and came back to help in the rebuilding of the larger Somalia and the Abduwak Community. 
                We in Particular have some who have come back as teachers among other professionals. Such teachers have been accorded an opportunity to work in the school.
